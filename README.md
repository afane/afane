### - Analyzing and Optimizing the Distribution of Blood Lead Level Testing for Children in New York City 
[Code](https://github.com/afane/BLLtesting_inNYC/blob/c8a28b6bfba7dccaeaa54d853f2966ef007b7bef/BLL_paper.ipynb)     [Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QHs9N8yAVW9inJrhglSRHrMrcPdASbrp/view?usp=sharing)

This study addresses lead exposure in New York City (NYC) children, focusing on disparities in
blood lead levels (BLL) across 42 neighborhoods from 2005 to 2021. Despite a citywide
decrease in BLL, significant neighborhood-level disparities persist, highlighting the need for
more targeted public health efforts.

We grouped neighborhoods into five categories according to their risk levels using clustering
methods, and then applied optimization techniques to develop a more effective strategy for
distributing testing resources to high-risk areas. This approach enhanced the detection of elevated
blood lead levels by 14.3%, leading to the potential identification of over 410 additional cases.
