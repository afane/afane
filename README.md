This study addresses lead exposure in New York City (NYC) children, focusing on disparities in
blood lead levels (BLL) across 42 neighborhoods from 2005 to 2021. Despite a citywide
decrease in BLL, significant neighborhood-level disparities persist, highlighting the need for
more targeted public health efforts.

I grouped neighborhoods into five categories according to their risk levels using clustering
methods, and then applied optimization techniques to develop a more effective strategy for
distributing testing resources to high-risk areas. This approach enhanced the detection of elevated
blood lead levels by 14.3%, leading to the potential identification of over 410 additional cases.

### ⚖️ Selecting Resampling Techniques and Classifiers for Imbalanced Datasets: A New Perspective

</p>
In this paper, we conduct a series of comprehensive experiments using 35 imbalanced datasets, 10 base classifiers and 8 resampling techniques, we then approach this challenge from a new perspective  by focusing on the performance of classifiers and resampling techniques based on the type of features present in the data; continuous or categorical. 

Our study aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a systematic framework for selecting an appropriate combination of resampling techniques and classifiers tailored to the characteristics of the imbalanced dataset at hand.

Using F1 score as the primary metric we can see that:

- For imbalanced datasets with numerical features: the best performing classifiers are Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting and Neural Networks
- For datasets with categorical features Random Forest, Decision Tree and Gradient boosting seem to perform better.
